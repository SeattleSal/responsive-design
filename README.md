Goal - practice responsive design using CSS

Followed along with Kevin Powell at : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn-DQCifeQQ&t=329s
It's a good review of HTML elements, css root variables, @media queries and some cool CSS tricks.

Biggest tip was to think big picture first - components, layout, color, fonts, responsiveness BEFORE diving in to more detailed parts.

Notes: I could not get the new CSS width: min(x%, y) to work so I used the older CSS way:
...
    width: x%;
    min-width: y
    ...
Will need to figure out why this didn't work.
